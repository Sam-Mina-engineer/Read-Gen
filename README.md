# Read-Gen: A Professional README Generator!

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-None-blue.svg)

## Description
 I started by copying the code for the solved Module 9 Mini Project to use as a guide. I set up the    gitignore, created my json files and downloaded my packages and dependencies. I removed the HTML stuff and reformatted with the hashtags  for the markdown headers and  updated the questions. After that I added the proper markdown anchors for the links to work. Did a test     push. Cleaning up and updating this Readme using the program itself to do it. Then will push again.
