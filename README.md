Professional README Generator. I copied and pasted the code from the solved mini project to use as a guideline template for this challenge. I set up the gitignore and created my json files and downloaded my packages and dependencies. I removed the HTML stuff and reformatted with the hashtags for the markdown headers and updated the questions.
